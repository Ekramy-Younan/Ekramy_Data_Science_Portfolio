# [Predicting Loan Defaults using Deep Learning with Keras & Tensorflow]https://github.com/Ekramy-Younan/Lending-Club-Loan
Problem Statement:
For companies like Lending Club, predicting loan default with high accuracy is very important. Using the historical Lending Club data from 2007 to 2015, build a deep learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans.

Analysis to be done:
Perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering. Build a deep learning model to predict load default using the historical public data (https://www.lendingcub.com).

Dataset:
The data set used here can be downloaded from here. The CSV file contains complete loan data for all loans issued through 2007â€“2015, including the current loan status and payment information. Additional features include annual income, public records, revolving balance, and others.
