# [Predicting Loan Defaults using Deep Learning with Keras & Tensorflow](https://github.com/Ekramy-Younan/Lending-Club-Loan)
Problem Statement:
For companies like Lending Club, predicting loan default with high accuracy is very important. Using the historical Lending Club data from 2007 to 2015, build a deep learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans.

Analysis to be done:
Perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering. Build a deep learning model to predict load default using the historical public data (https://www.lendingcub.com).

Dataset:
The data set used here can be downloaded from here. The CSV file contains complete loan data for all loans issued through 2007–2015, including the current loan status and payment information. Additional features include annual income, public records, revolving balance, and others.


# [Income-Qualification](https://github.com/Ekramy-Younan/Income-Qualification)

**DESCRIPTION
  * Identify the level of income qualification needed for the families in Latin America.

**Problem Statement Scenario:
  * Many social programs have a hard time ensuring that the right people are given enough aid. It’s tricky when a program focuses on the poorest segment of the population. This segment of the population can’t provide the necessary income and expense records to prove that they qualify.
  * In Latin America, a popular method called Proxy Means Test (PMT) uses an algorithm to verify income qualification. With PMT, agencies use a model that considers a family’s observable household attributes like the material of their walls and ceiling or the assets found in their homes to classify them and predict their level of need.
  * While this is an improvement, accuracy remains a problem as the region’s population grows and poverty declines.
  * The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)believes that new methods beyond traditional econometrics, based on a dataset of Costa Rican household characteristics, might help improve PMT’s performance.
